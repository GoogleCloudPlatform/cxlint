# This Dialogflow CX rcfile contains a best-effort configuration to uphold the
# best-practices and style described in the Dialogflow CX style guides:
#   https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agent-design
#   https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/voice-agent-design
#
# Additionally, some working best practices from our delivery teams that are
# not currently documented above have been codified as rules within CX Lint.
#
# This version has been modified to expect 4 space indents instead of 2.

# Providing the Agent ID for the Dialogflow CX agent that is being linted will
# enabled deep linked results from the logger.

# Agent linting can be limited to specific resources by adding them to the include
